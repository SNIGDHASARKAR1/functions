        "1. What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  A function is a block of code that is defined outside of any class. It can be called by its name and can take parameters and return values. Functions are independent and do not belong to any object or class.\n",
        "      A method is a function that is defined inside a class and is associated with an object. Methods can access and modify the data of the object they belong to. They always take at least one parameter, self, which refers to the instance of the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. . Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "      Parameters are the variables listed inside the parentheses in the function definition. They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called. Parameters define the type and number of values that a function can accept.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Arguments\n",
        "\n",
        "      Arguments are the actual values passed to the function when it is called. They fill the parameters during the function's execution. Arguments can be variables, values, or objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  The different ways to define and call a function in python are:\n",
        "      i. Regular functions, ii. Lambda functions iii. Functions with default arguments, iv. Functions with variable length arguments,\n",
        "      v. Nested functions, vi. Recursive functions.\n",

        "4.  What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n",
        "\n",
        "   -  The return statement in a Python function is used to exit the function and send back a value (or values) to the caller.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data. It maintains the state of the iteration and produces the next value when requested.\n",
        "  \n",
        "   Iterator is different from iterables in the following ways:\n",
        "  \n",
        "   Creation: All iterators are iterables, but not all iterables are iterators. Iterables are converted to iterators using the iter() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Functionality: Iterables can be iterated over multiple times (e.g., in multiple loops), while an iterator maintains its state and can only be traversed once.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Generators in Python are a special type of iterable that allow you to iterate over data without storing it all in memory at once. They are particularly useful for handling large datasets or streams of data where you want to process each item on-the-fly.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  Generators provide significant advantages over regular functions in terms of memory efficiency, performance, ease of writing complex iterations, and handling infinite sequences. They enable you to write more efficient and readable code for a wide range of applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  A lambda function in Python is a small, anonymous function defined with the lambda keyword. Unlike regular functions defined with def, a lambda function can have any number of arguments but only one expression. The expression is evaluated and returned when the function is called.\n",
